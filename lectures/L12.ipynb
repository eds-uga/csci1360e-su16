    "\n",
    "1: In Part 1 of the lecture when we read in and printed the first few lines of *Alice in Wonderland*, you'll notice each line of text has a blank line in between. Explain why, and how to fix it (so that printing each line shows text of the book the same way you'd see it in the file).\n",
    "\n",
    "2: Describe the circumstances under which append \"a\" mode and write \"w\" mode are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "3: Dictionaries can be very complex; for a good example, just have a look at how big a dictionary representation of a single Tweet is [https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets): there's `\"created_at\"`, which is a string indicating the time the tweet was created; `\"contributors\"`, which is a dictionary unto itself identifying users participating in a thread; `\"entities\"`, a dictionary of lists that includes hashtags and URLs in the tweet; and `\"user\"`, which is another gargantuan dictionary containing all the information about the author of the tweet. What would be a good format to store these tweets in on the hard drive? What if we were sending these tweets somewhere, such as a smartphone app; would we use a different format? Explain."
