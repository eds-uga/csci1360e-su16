    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Informatics, or “data science,” are rapidly becoming essential skills for scientists across fields; in addition to field-specific specializations, researchers require knowledge of and experience with quantitative analytical techniques for extracting knowledge from raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course aims to provide an introduction to concepts in scientific programming and data science using the Python language. Students are given hands-on opportunities to learn techniques applicable to quantitative analyses across a broad range of fields. These core techniques involve formulating solutions in terms of their inputs and outputs (functional programming), repeated operations (loops), branching operations (conditionals), different methods of organizing data (data structures), how to implement an optimal problem-solving strategy (algorithm design), and methods for visualizing and interpreting results."

It is meant to be an introduction to these concepts in the larger context of data science and scientific programming through the lens of the Python ecosystem. The course is targeted at undergraduate students across fields who, irrespective of their ultimate career goals, are interested in a foundational understanding of programming and quantitative data analytics."

    "\n",
    " - You'll need a computer with an internet connection. If you're reading this, you can most likely claim victory on this one.\n",

    "   - Firefox (if you have enough memory)\n",
    "   - Chrome (if you have enough spare CPU cycles)\n",

    " - **There is/are no required textbook(s)**. There are a few recommended texts that I will <strike>steal</strike> borrow from over the course of the semester, and you're welcome to check them out or purchase them if you're interested, but any material from them that you'll need will be reproduced here in some form.\n",

    "\n",
    "Kinda boring, but absolutely necessary. Please be familiar with these points so you and I don't have to have unpleasant conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    " - Assignments are due by 11:59:59pm on the noted date. Assignments turned in after this deadline will lose 25/100 points for every subsequent 24 hour-period they are late.\n",
    " - The presence or absence of any form of help or collaboration, whether given or received, must be explicitly stated and disclosed in full by all involved, on the first page of their assignment (\"I did not give or receive any help on this assignment\" or \"I helped [person] with [specific task].\"). Collaboration without full disclosure will be handled severely; except in usual extenuating circumstances, my policy is to fail the student(s) for the entire course.\n",
    " - **DO NOT COPY CODE**. I cannot stress this enough. Coding is a lot like writing: everyone has their own style that is very recognizable. It's not difficult to tell when students share their code. Don't do it.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Exams\n",
    "\n",
    " - Any material covered in lecture or homework assignments is considered fair game for both exams.\n",
    " - Both exams will be cumulative. I may even be lazy / clever and copy-paste midterm questions into the final.\n",
    " - The exact format of both exams will be variable; previous years' exams have included a mixture of multiple choice, matching, true/false, and hand-coding. However, this being the first online course in CSCI 1360, it is not yet clear what the ultimate formats will be.\n",
    " - Time permitting, \"practice\" versions of the exams will be released. I will make every effort, but it will depend entirely on my schedule when the time comes; as such, do not assume it will happen.\n",
    " - **Exams will be timed.** You can complete them within the time frame allotted in under the maximum time interval. As this is an online course, it's viable for multiple people to take the exam while co-located; please resist this option. Colloboration in **any** form during either exam will be grounds for immediate failure of the course.\n",

    "The [UGA Academic Honesty Policy](https://ovpi.uga.edu/academic-honesty/academic-honesty-policy) is the final word on these matters. Lack of knowledge of these policies is not sufficient justification for violations. If in doubt, **ask me**."
